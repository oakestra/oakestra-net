// TunDevice abstracts the platform TUN device the proxy reads outgoing
// packets from and writes ingoing ones to. ReadBatch/WriteBatch coalesce
// several packets into one syscall where the kernel supports it
// (BatchSize() > 1 - it's 1 on Darwin and on Linux without IFF_VNET_HDR).
//
// Every implementation agrees on buffer layout: bufs[i][tunHeaderOffset :
// tunHeaderOffset+sizes[i]] holds the packet, on both Read and Write. See
// tunHeaderOffset for why the headroom exists.
type TunDevice interface {
	// n may be less than len(bufs), or 0; only [0, n) is populated. A
	// partially split GSO superpacket comes back as n packets and no error.
	ReadBatch(bufs [][]byte, sizes []int) (int, error)
	// WriteBatch may mutate bufs; the caller must not read them again
	// afterwards assuming they're unchanged.
	WriteBatch(bufs [][]byte) (int, error)

// tunHeaderOffset is the headroom every buffer handed to Read/WriteBatch
// reserves before the packet itself. offset 0 is not safe on either platform
// this repo builds for - verified by reading golang.zx2c4.com/wireguard/tun's
// own Read/Write:
//
//   - Darwin's utun prepends a 4-byte address-family word: Write rejects
//     offset < 4 outright (io.ErrShortBuffer), and Read indexes
//     bufs[0][offset-4:], which panics on a negative slice bound at offset 0.
//   - Linux, once the kernel has negotiated IFF_VNET_HDR (i.e. whenever
//     BatchSize() > 1), needs 10 bytes immediately before the packet for the
//     virtio_net_hdr Write expects there: it computes offset -= 10 and
//     slices at that, which is also a negative (panicking) bound at offset 0.
//
// 10 covers both - the 6 spare bytes on Darwin, and on a pre-vnet_hdr Linux
// kernel where Write never even looks at the header room, are simply unused
// padding.
